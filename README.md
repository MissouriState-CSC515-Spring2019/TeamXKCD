# Overview

We will create a single page application that will allow the user to see the current and previous XKCD comic strips, as well as information about those strips and the author.

## XkcdProject515

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x to run. Install the Angular CLI with the command `npm install -g @angular/cli`

Once finished, run `npm install` while in the XKCD project directory.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
`ng serve --open` or `ng serve -o` automatically opens the app to the default browser.


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
